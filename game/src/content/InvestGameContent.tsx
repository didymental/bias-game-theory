      Let's examine this from a strategic perspective with uncertainty. <br />
      <br />
          What we have just observed is "momentum trading".
          Momentum trading is like catching a wave at the beach.
          You see a stock rising for several days in a row, and it's tempting to ride that wave, hoping for more gains. <br />
      <br />
          However, there's a catch. Just as the ocean is unpredictable, so is the stock market.
          It's like a real-life version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, where everyone is trying to make the best decision. <br />
      <br />
          In this scenario, the "payoff" for selling as the stock price increases can be rewarding.
          But, here's where the uncertainty comes in â€“ if too many traders decide to sell when it's high, the wave can come crashing down, and the price can plummet.
          This is where strategic interdependence comes into play - akin to how in the Prisoner's Dilemma, both prisoners are better off if they both stay silent (buy/ hold), but if one decides to talk (sell), they may get a reduced sentence while the other faces a harsh penalty.<br />
      <br />
          Price movement is always influenced by how other people are playing their strategies, creating a sense of strategic interdependence in the market. So, while riding the momentum wave can be profitable, it's essential to remember that the market is full of uncertainties, similar to the complex decisions that arise in the Prisoner's Dilemma

            Alex has two possible decisions: Invest, and Don't Invest. <br />
